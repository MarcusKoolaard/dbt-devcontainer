# Using `dbt` with Visual Studio Code `.devcontainer`

Example repository showing how to use `dbt` with some extra goodies inside a Visual Studio Code `.devcontainer` environment.

## Quickstart

The quickest way to get started is to use [GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces). You can create one from this repository and get a development environment available in your browser.

You can also clone the repository and use [Remote Containers](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers) to run the development environment.

Once you're inside, move to the `jaffle_shop` folder and follow the README instructions! You should be able to seed the data with `dbt seed` and see it in the SQLTools icon in the sidebar.
